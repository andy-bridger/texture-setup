Quick cobble together of a visualisation for what is happening in a texture experiment. Visualisation shows the Ewald Sphere as well as the sphere construction for the pole figure. Shows how detector positions correspond to points in the pole figure and by looking at when the reciprocal lattices points align with the detectors on the ewald sphere, you can see which sample orientations will lead to signal in the pole figure
